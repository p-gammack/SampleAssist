# SampleAssist

This is a tool used to assist the recording and editing of instrument samples to help make the creation of digital multi-sampled instruments faster and less tedious. 

The tool is run as plugin within a digital audio workstation (DAW), such as Ableton Live or Logic Pro, to piggy-back of its audio system.

(Currently in pre-release with many missing features)
